          Explain the concept of Responsive Design. What does the term mean?
        </h3>
        <p>
          It is a design principle that focuses on the need that website should
          be viewable appropriately on all devices regardless of screen size.
          Basically the website should be able to scaled up and down to match
          the screen.
        </p>
        <h3>How does responsive design relate to web technologies?</h3>
        <p>
          The realm of web developement what that means is all devices are
          servered the same HTML structure but the CSS applied varies based on
          the width of the screen. The different CSS rules applied results in
          layout changes to make the content more accessible without issues such
          as horizontal scrolling, zoom issues, and content being cut off. The
          idea is too also save the developer development time by not designing
          and coding seperate websites for each viewing device. This will it
          easier to maintain the code base over time and also easier to add to
          new features. The key to this adaptability is the media queries of CSS
          5. No matter what new device is released media query rules can be
          written to support it.

          What did you learn about building web apps for different devices
          through your research?
        </h3>
        <p>
          The best way to build a web app layout is to start with the mobile
          layout first. It tends to be simpler with the single column layout
          that is most common for smallest dvices like smartphones. Then add
          queries to adjust the layout as the screen size grows with each larger
          devices. This approach will simplify the code written. Also,
          properties values should be written in relative units such as % or rem
          it makes it easier to adjust all the values at once should the need
          arise. using div element as containers for content like images makes
          it easier to resize them for different screens. The new grid system
          can make the main content
        </p>
        <h3>Finally, describe your learning experience in the course.</h3>
        <p>
          I enjoyed the course content very much and although the concepts were
          fairly easy to grasp I know that repeat practice is the only way to
          master it to production level. The flexibility of JS at first made it
          quite difficult to get things done precisely because there are so many
          different approaches. very different from C/C++ languages. The built
          in methods are very usefull without having to worry about additional
          libraries or modules. I would have liked the course to have touched on
          SVGs and more on asyncronous JS.
