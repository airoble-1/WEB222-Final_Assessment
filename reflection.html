          Explain the concept of Responsive Design. What does the term mean?
        </h3>
        <p>
          It is a design principle developed articulated by Ethan Marcotte in
          2010 that focuses on the need that website should be viewable
          appropriately on all devices regardless of screen size. Basically, the
          website should be able to be scaled up and down to match the screen.
          This principle started to be become popular around the time mobile
          devices surpassed computer visits to webpages. This was very different
          from what was being done at the time – building separate pages for
          mobile vs pc. More than just screen size developers should also take
          into mind orientation.
        </p>
        <h3>How does responsive design relate to web technologies?</h3>
        <p>
          In the realm of web development and design what that means is all
          devices are served the same HTML structure, but the CSS applied varies
          based on the width and/or orientation of the screen. The different CSS
          rules applied results in layout changes to make the content more
          accessible without issues such as horizontal scrolling, zoom issues,
          and content being cut off. The idea is to also reduce development time
          by not designing and coding separate websites for each viewing device.
          This will make it easier to maintain the code base over time and
          easier to add to new features. The key to this adaptability is the
          media queries of CSS 5. No matter what new device is released media
          query rules can be written to support it. Media queries in conjunction
          with flexible grids to product fluid columns and images. Currently
          developers use breakpoints with the media queries to define layouts
          for example @320px, 768px, 1240px.
        </p>
        <h3>
          What did you learn about building web apps for different devices
          through your research?
        </h3>
        <p>
          The best way to build a web app layout is to start with the mobile
          layout first. It tends to be simpler with the single column layout
          that is most common for smallest devices like smartphones. Then add
          queries to adjust the layout as the screen size grows with each larger
          device. This approach will simplify the code written. Also, properties
          values should be written in relative units such as % or rem it makes
          it easier to adjust all the values at once should the need arise. Use
          of div elements as containers for content like images makes it easier
          to resize them for different screens. This flexibility can be achieved
          with grid or flex – I prefer grid with its 2D capability.
        </p>
        <h3>Finally, describe your learning experience in the course.</h3>
        <p>
          I enjoyed the course content very much and although the concepts were
          easy to grasp I know that repeat practice is the only way to master it
          to production level. The flexibility of JS at first made it quite
          difficult to get things done precisely because there are so many
          different approaches. very different from C/C++ languages. The
          built-in methods are very useful without having to worry about
          additional libraries or modules. I would have liked the course to have
          touched on SVGs and more on asynchronous JS. I also appreciate that JS
          has the ability for programmers to decide which paradigm to adopt
          functional or OOP or a mixture of both. I think students should be
          exposed to the newer features of the language.
